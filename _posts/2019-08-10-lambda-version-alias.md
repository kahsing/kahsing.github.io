<p>By using versioning, you can manage your in-production function code in AWS Lambda better. When you use versioning in AWS Lambda, you can publish one or more versions of your Lambda function. As a result, you can work with different variations of your Lambda function in your development workflow, such as development, beta, and production.

Each Lambda function version has a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN). After you publish a version, it can't be changed</p>
